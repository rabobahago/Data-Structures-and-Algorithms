Arrays
Binary Search - An algorithm for finding the index of a specific element in a sorted array.
Merge Sort - A sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach to sort an array in O(nlogn) time complexity.
Quick Sort - A sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach to sort an array in O(nlogn) time complexity.

Trees
Binary Tree Traversal - An algorithm for visiting all nodes in a binary tree in a specific order.
Binary Search Tree - A binary tree data structure that is used to store values in a sorted order.

Graphs
Depth First Search - An algorithm for visiting all nodes in a graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Breadth First Search - An algorithm for visiting all nodes in a graph by exploring all neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level.

Strings
Longest Common Substring - An algorithm for finding the longest substring that is common to two or more strings.
Edit Distance - An algorithm for finding the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another.

Maps
Hash Map - A data structure that provides constant time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs.

Stacks
Stack Implementation - An implementation of the stack data structure using an array.

Matrices
Matrix Multiplication - An algorithm for multiplying two matrices.
